# Harp v0.17.0

## Jade

We finally upgraded Jade, doing our best to mitigate issues.

### Doctype issue

This will work but will throw a warning in your console:

```jade
!!!
html
  body
    //- Etc.
```

Please change it as soon as you can:

```jade
doctype
html
  body
    //- Etc.
```

Other weird things with Jade.

Can’t do this with a blank line after `:markdown` anymore:

```jade
body
  :markdown

    # The title

    This is my Markdown post.
```

Can do this:

```jade
body
  :markdown
    # The title

    This is my Markdown post.
```

Can’t define variables without prefixing it with a `- ` anymore. Before, this would work:

```jade
articles = []
```

Now, do this instead:

```jade
- var articles = []
```

The `- ` is a way to write JavaScript literally inside of Jade.

This issue also affected the [hb-remedy](#) boilerplate, so if you ever used it or based your work upon it, please make this change.

## Less

- At 2.5.0 so Bootstrap 3 should now work okay

## Sass

- v3.0.0-beta.5

On the latest beta, which moves dramatically closer to parity with Ruby Sass, so expect a lot more framework stuff to just work. Awesome job to that team, we’re very happy we went with Libsass

## Other stuff from v0.16.0

- Slash indifference
- IP binding

# Harp v0.14.0 – Implicit Autoprefixing

A new release of Harp is available today. Harp now takes care of vendor prefixing for you, via the fantastic [Autoprefixer](https://github.com/ai/autoprefixer).

## Preprocessor updates

We prefer to keep all of Harp’s preprocessors up-to-date. Since the last release, LESS and Stylus were updated with minor bug fixes.

* [LESS is now at version 1.7.4](https://github.com/less/less.js/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#174), which includes various bug fixes.
* [Stylus is now at version 0.47.3](https://github.com/LearnBoost/stylus/blob/master/History.md#0473--2014-07-22), which fixes support support for schema-less urls inside `url()`.

## Publish your project

Harp also helps power the [Harp Platform](http://www.harp.io), a front-end publishing integrated with Dropbox. It’s the fastest way to deploy your new project—you’ll never need to worry about manually compiling your files again.

## What’s next for Harp

We love contributions to Harp and [Terraform](https://github.com/sintaxi/terraform); Autoprefixer integration was suggested by [@lunelson](https://github.com/lunelson) and kindly implemented by [@geelen](https://github.com/geelen).

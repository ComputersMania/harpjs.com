This version of [harpjs.com](http://harpjs.com) uses [Bootstrap](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap). Bootstrap is in `_bootstrap` and is not modified.

To override the default behaviour of Bootstrap, make a copy of the component in `_override` and import it. Make the changes on top of Bootstrap, removing the lines that will not change from the original.

For example, the main banner on harpjs.com uses a `.jumbotron` class from Bootstrap, which is located in `_bootstrap/jumbotron.less`. This is augmented with additional styles, like the additional `.jumbotron-knockout` class, in `_overrides/jumbotron.less`

For quick and less modular changes, work with in a `.section` in `application.less`, using non-Bootstrap classes.
